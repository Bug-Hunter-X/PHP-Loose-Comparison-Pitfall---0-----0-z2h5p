This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in PHP: the misuse of loose comparison operators. The `bug.php` file contains code that incorrectly uses loose comparison (`==`) resulting in a bug. The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates the fix using strict comparison (`===`).  This subtle bug can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
