This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and comparison operators.  The `==` operator performs loose comparison, meaning it will implicitly convert the types before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers. In this case,  '0' (string) and 0 (integer) will evaluate to true using `==`, while they would evaluate to false using `===` (strict comparison).
